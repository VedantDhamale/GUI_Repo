## Craters & Boulders Detection

Crater and boulder detection using _YOLOv8 and SAM (Segment Anything Model)_, which is an advanced detection algorithm. It is based on a region proposal and segmentation approach, offering efficient detection and segmentation of craters and boulders in real-time with high accuracy. The model processes images at a frame rate of approximately 30-40 FPS on average GPUs, ensuring real-time performance, even under varying illumination conditions and for craters and boulders of different shapes and sizes.
